Development of a Raspberry Pi remote controlled car
=========== 

This blog series will document all steps we're taking in Engim, to develop a fully remote 
controlled car using a Raspberry Pi. 

This project aim to be a learning project, so it's not a fully tested 
system solution, and the decisions made might be far from the so called 
perfect design. But, as all of our lerning has been possible by the free and open 
resources avaliable in internet, with this project we intend to
give back a little of what we recived from the community.
